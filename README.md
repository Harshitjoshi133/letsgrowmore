## Introduction

This repository hosts a variety of Java projects that simulate real-world scenarios, allowing you to apply your programming knowledge in practical contexts. By completing these projects, you will gain proficiency in various Java concepts, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and user interface development.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

1. **Currency Converter**
   Build an application that allows users to convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. Users can input an amount in one currency and get the equivalent amount in another currency.

2. **Scientific Calculator**
   Create a comprehensive scientific calculator with various functions including basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, and more. Implement a user-friendly interface to interact with the calculator's features.

3. **Text Editor**
   Develop a simple text editor that enables users to create, edit, and save text files. Implement features such as text formatting, syntax highlighting, and the ability to open and save files in different formats.

4. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**
   Build a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Implement the game logic, user input handling, and a mechanism to determine the winner or a draw.

## Getting Started

To start working on these projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
